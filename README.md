# PicoRV32 Physical Design using OpenLANE & Sky130

This repository documents my 5-Day Physical Design journey of implementing the 
PicoRV32 RISC-V Core on the SkyWater 130nm Technology using the OpenLANE ASIC Flow.

Originally based on the 10-Day Physical Design course by Kunal Ghosh (VSD), 
this repository summarizes the complete RTL-to-GDSII flow into 5 structured days.

---

## Objective
✔ Understand ASIC Physical Design Flow  
✔ Run complete RTL → GDSII flow  
✔ Work with OpenLANE, OpenROAD, Magic, KLayout  
✔ Analyze Timing, Power, Area  
✔ Generate Final GDS for fabrication-ready design

## Tools Used
- OpenLANE
- OpenROAD
- Magic Layout
- KLayout
- OpenSTA
- Sky130 PDK
